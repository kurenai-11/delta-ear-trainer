# delta-ear-trainer
My attempt at creating an ear trainer for my own purposes.
Using Native Android(Jetpack Compose, Kotlin) and Bass(https://un4seen.com).

Working prototype.

I liked how the Complete Ear Trainer and Functional Ear Trainer worked, but they both didn't have enough features and it was hard to connect them into a single training system.

So I plan to create an app with both the functional(in-context) and intervallic(without a context) training in a single app. First as separate training modes, and then as a whole training system.

And, as a person who is slowly developing Absolute Pitch, I also want the app to include not only Relative Pitch training, but also AP training as well.
